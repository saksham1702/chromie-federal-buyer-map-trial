# 02 - Organization and program-office map

The machine-readable graph is `research/memory/organization_seed.json` (nodes, edges, validity dates, one or
more dated official citations each). This document explains the shape of the map, the
reorganization timeline it encodes, the alias problem, and how the map is maintained when the
Navy moves offices around.

## In plain terms

The pilot portfolio sits inside three layers that have each been renamed or reorganized in the
last seven years: the systems command (SPAWAR became NAVWAR in 2019), the portfolio layer
(PEO EIS split into PEO Digital and PEO MLB in 2020; PEO C4I moved under a new Portfolio
Acquisition Executive in 2026), and the program offices themselves (names drift between official
pages). The map therefore stores every organization with the dates a name or parent was valid,
and every claim with the document that says so. Nothing is overwritten when the Navy reorganizes;
a new edge with a start date is added and the old one gets an end date.

## 3. Aliases and identifier inconsistencies

| Where | How the same office is written | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official pages | `PMW 160`, `PMW/A 170`, `PMA/PMW 101` | canonical form |
| LRAE requirement-office column and PID numbers | `PMW-160`, `PMW/A-170`, `PMA/PMW-101`, plus `C4IEXEC` / `PEO-C4I` for the front office | alias table in the seed graph |
| FPDS and USAspending descriptions | `PMW 160`, `PMW/A 170`, `PEOC4I`, `PEO C4I`, `PROGRAM MANAGER, WARFARE TACTICAL NETWORKS (PMW 160)` | regex over the alias table; PEO-level mentions resolve to the portfolio, not an office |
| Office names over time | PMW 150 "Navy" vs "Naval" Command and Control Systems; PMW 790 with and without "Tactical" | both names kept with dates |
| SAM.gov notice text | "Navy Command and Control Program Office (PMW 150)", "International Integration Program Office (PMW 740)", "MIDS International Program Office (IPO)", "Naval Enterprise Networks Program Office (PMW 205)" | first-sentence office names; IPO/MPO map to PMA/PMW 101, NEN to PMW 205 |
| PEO Digital and PEO MLB in the LRAE | `Pf007NERP`, `Pf004MNHR`, `Pf005NABS`, `Pf008MLBFO`, `Digital TD`, `PEO-MLB`, `PCE` instead of PMW codes | recorded as HQ/PEO codes |
| NIWC requirement offices | `LSUBP000xx - <division> - NIWCLANT`, `NP-xxxxx - <competency> - NIWCPAC` | technical-center divisions, never program offices |
| Contracting offices | `N00039 - NAVWAR` (LRAE), `NAVAL INFORMATION WARFARE SYSTEMS` (FPDS), `N00039` (PIID prefix) | one node with all three |
| Command name in old records | award descriptions written after 2019 say "NAVWAR" even for 2016 awards | descriptions are re-authored at modification time; never date an organization from an award description |

### 3a. Where the PMWs sit in the new portfolio structure (candidate mapping)

The PAE Mission Systems site names five capability portfolios without listing which former
offices belong to each. Reading the portfolio names against the PEO C4I tear sheets suggests:
PMW 120, PMW 130 and PMW 150 under "Naval Intelligence, C2, Cyber Warfare & Information
Operations"; PMA/PMW 101, PMW/A 170 and PMW 770 under "Sensors, PNT, EW & Communications
Systems"; PEO Digital's offices under "Digital Infrastructure & Services"; PEO MLB's under
"Warfighter Enterprise Business Services"; PEO IWS under "Combat Systems & Fires"; PMW 740, 750,
760 and 790 (integration and international offices) unplaced. This is an inference; the seed
graph keeps the PEO C4I parentage with the dated consolidation edge.

## 4. NAVSEA, ONR and NRL organizations

NAVSEA, ONR and NRL organizations are in the memory as their sources print them
(`org_memory_lrae.py`): the LRAE office and contracting columns, the NAVSEA HQ deputy program
manager list of July 2025 (PMS offices under PEO CARRIERS, PEO SHIPS, SEA 21, PEO IWS, PEO USC
and the directorates, 50 parent edges) and twelve statements read off the official NSWC Corona
and NSWC Indian Head department pages (`research/memory/org_page_statements.json`, passages checked
against the saved pages). The 168 generated nodes are all `draft` and carry the sheet's names
(`NSWCPD`, `Newport`) rather than full names. Department placements that the generator infers
from the row's contracting office say so (`evidence_class: inferred`). Rows that no source
places (`TBD`, cells naming several organizations, unplaced free text, organizations outside the
Department of the Navy, fleet units) stay unresolved. Shipyard pages name no codes publicly; the
Corona and Indian Head pages spell several departments differently from the sheet, so the
statements file records each reading as the agent's judgment.

## 5. Maintaining the map when the Navy changes

1. A weekly hash diff on the official organization pages and tear-sheet URLs opens a review item
   when content changes.
2. Reorganization releases (DVIDS, PAE domains, navy.mil) are read for organization names; a
   new edge gets `valid_from` set to the release's effective date, the superseded edge gets
   `valid_to` the day before. Nothing is deleted.
3. Conflicting official statements (as with NAVWAR's pages in September 2026) are both kept and
   flagged `conflict_flagged` until a later document settles them.
4. New codes seen in the LRAE requirement-office column or in award text are added to the alias
   table as `unverified` until an official page confirms the office and parent.
5. People edges carry the tear-sheet or release date as the observation date and end when a
   change-of-command release names a successor.

Mapping to Chromie: nodes are `gov_organizations` rows (with `org_type`, aliases,
`valid_from/valid_to`, provenance columns); edges are `gov_organization_relationships` rows; the
2026 names map to aliases on the existing PEO C4I rows created from the 2023 article, and the
consolidation maps to a `consolidated_into` relationship to a PAE Mission Systems organization
dated 2026-05-11.
