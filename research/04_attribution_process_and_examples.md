# 04 - Contract-to-program-office attribution: process and reviewed examples

Written 2026-09-16. Machine-readable examples: `attribution_examples.json` (one record per
reviewed contract, order, vehicle or modification, with quoted passages and source URLs). The
table below is generated from that file.

## In plain terms

A contract record almost never says outright which program office owns the need. NAVWAR's
contracting office code appears on every action, but it serves three PEOs, a NAVSEA program
office and NAVWAR's own headquarters, so the code alone narrows nothing. The description text
does carry the answer often (about half of the sampled actions name a PMW), the SAM.gov notice
for the action's solicitation almost always names the office in its first sentence, the
Long-Range Acquisition Estimate names the requirement office for the follow-on of many existing
contracts, and tear sheets map program names to offices. The process below applies those sources
in a fixed order and records how strong the result is, including when it is "we do not know".

## 1. The repeatable process

1. **Fix the unit.** Attribute the order, contract or vehicle, not the modification. Read the base
   award's description first; modifications carry text such as "DE-OBLIGATION" or "CEILING
   REALIGNMENT" (EX15, EX16, EX19). Orders are attributed separately from their parent vehicle; a
   multiple-award vehicle such as SeaPort-NxG is never attributed (EX01, EX04, EX05), a
   single-purpose vehicle can be (EX13).
2. **Read the offices on the record.** Contracting office and funding office come from FPDS
   (`contractingOfficeID`, `fundingRequestingOfficeID`). They are recorded as facts about the
   buyer and the payer and are never promoted to ownership. A funding office in another systems
   command is strong evidence against the pilot portfolio (EX09).
3. **Look for an office code or explicit ownership language in the description** ("PMW 160",
   "PMW/A 170", "PROGRAM MANAGER, WARFARE TACTICAL NETWORKS (PMW 160)", "IN SUPPORT OF PEO MLB
   PMW 220"). A match against the alias table in `organization_seed.json` yields
   `directly_documented`. Lists of several offices yield a multi-office result with a primary and
   supporting offices; unknown tokens stay unresolved inside it (EX07). A PEO-level mention
   ("PEO C4I") resolves to the portfolio or its front office, not to a PMW (EX17).
4. **Read the SAM.gov notice for the action's solicitation number.** NAVWAR's presolicitations,
   RFPs, J&As and award notices open with "in support of PEO C4I, <office name> (PMW xxx)"; the
   notice is an official record of the same action, so a match is `directly_documented` (EX09,
   EX12-EX16). SAM.gov's site API returns notices back to at least 2014 by solicitation number.
   Task orders competed inside SeaPort-NxG have no SAM.gov notice (nine solicitation numbers
   checked, none found), so this step yields nothing for them.
5. **Check the LRAE.** Match the contract number against the LRAE "Existing Contract Number"
   column and read the "Associated Program or Requirement Office" of the follow-on row. Because
   the LRAE is an estimate about a future requirement, it corroborates rather than documents:
   the result is `inferred` unless the award text also names the office (EX08, EX09, EX13).
6. **Map program names through official tear sheets.** "CANES", "ADNS", "MIDS-LVT", "NMT" map to
   offices through the tear sheet that lists them as the office's programs. Result: `inferred`,
   with counterevidence recorded when another organization also holds requirements for the same
   program (EX14). A functional match (a program's purpose fits an office's mission) is
   `ambiguous`, not inferred (EX16).
7. **Date the ancestry.** The office's parent chain is read from the seed graph as of the
   action date: PEO C4I under NAVWAR until 2026-05-10, consolidated into PAE Mission Systems from
   2026-05-11; PEO EIS offices moved to PEO Digital or PEO MLB in May 2020 (EX12, EX13).
   Descriptions are re-authored at modification time, so the organization name in a description
   never dates anything (EX02).
8. **Record the result** with the quoted passages, document, observation date, evidence class,
   counterevidence, and, when unresolved, what would resolve it (EX19). Every record goes to a
   reviewer when the class is `inferred`, `ambiguous` or `unresolved`.

## 2. Evidence classes

| Class | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `directly_documented` | an official record of the action (award description, or the SAM.gov notice for the action's solicitation) names the office or its code | EX01-EX07, EX09-EX18 |
| `inferred` | the office is named only in a corroborating official document (LRAE row for the follow-on, tear sheet program list) | EX08 |
| `ambiguous` | candidates exist but no official document ties the program to an office | none remaining (EX16 was ambiguous until the solicitation notice was read) |
| `unresolved` | no owner signal in any retrieved record; recorded with the path to resolution | EX19 |

Things that never establish ownership on their own: contracting office, funding office, vendor,
vehicle, NAICS, PSC, platform or system name, or a semantic resemblance.

Coverage of the set: seven PEO C4I program offices plus the PEO C4I front office
(PMA/PMW 101, PMW 120, PMW 150, PMW 160, PMW/A 170, PMW 740, PMW 760), two PEO MLB offices, one
PEO Digital office (PMW 205), one NAVSEA program office (PMS 485, PEO Submarines), one explicit
unknown. Seventeen of nineteen are directly documented once the solicitation notices are read;
the one remaining inference (EX08) is a SeaPort-NxG order whose competition never appeared on
SAM.gov. Three Booz Allen orders under
one SeaPort-NxG vehicle resolve to three different offices (EX01, EX04, EX05); one Falconwood
vendor serves PEO MLB and PEO Digital (EX11); one NAVWAR HQ contract is funded by NAVSEA HQ for a
NAVSEA office (EX09); one order names three offices (EX07); one office changed parent twice while
its contract ran (EX12); one modification signed after 2026-05-11 carries a different ancestry
from the base award (EX13).

## 4. What the examples say about the sources

- Award descriptions name a PMW often enough to attribute a large share of NAVWAR HQ actions
  directly; the rest need the LRAE or tear sheets.
- The LRAE's "Existing Contract Number" column is the single best public bridge from a
  forecast to an incumbent contract, and its requirement-office column is the best public
  statement of who owns a follow-on requirement. It lists the vehicle rather than the order in
  some rows (EX01), so matching must try both.
- The funding office separates systems commands but not offices inside NAVWAR, because PEO
  offices fund through NAVWAR HQ.
- NIWC actions attribute to technical-center divisions unless text or funding says otherwise;
  the same program (ADNS) appears both as a PMW 160 production buy and as NIWC Pacific
  in-service engineering work (EX14).
- SAM.gov notice text resolved every `inferred` and `ambiguous` case that had a notice: six
  examples moved to `directly_documented` on 2026-09-16 once the site API was used. What remains
  inferred or unresolved are SeaPort-NxG orders and an NIWC vehicle whose task orders were not
  pulled. The notices' attachment lists hold no documents, only PIEE Solicitation Module links,
  so the statement of work itself stays behind the PIEE login; the notice synopsis is what SAM.gov
  publishes and it is enough to name the office.
- The documented public API host (api.sam.gov) answered 404 from two networks; the keyless site
  API that the SAM.gov web application uses (and that Chromie's runner already uses) worked for
  notice detail, description text, attachment lists and archived search.

## 5. Replaying through Chromie's resolver

The classes above line up with the production resolver's evidence rules
(`program_office_resolver.py`: an office code or explicit ownership language is required;
contracting office, platform, NAICS and vendor cannot create ownership; abstention is a result).
Each record here is a gold candidate: `directly_documented` rows as positives, EX09-EX12 as
hard negatives for the PEO C4I portfolio, EX07 as a multi-program case, EX12 and EX13 as
reorganization cases, EX16 and EX19 as abstentions. Replaying them is a one-hour task once the
seed graph is loaded as organization rows; it is not done in this phase.
