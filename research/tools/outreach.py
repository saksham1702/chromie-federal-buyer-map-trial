"""From what a company sells to one outreach e-mail, walked by a model through the Navy record: the agency, the command,
the program executive office and the program office that buys the capability, that office's requirements, the
initiatives above it, the people the record ties to it, and a letter written from those alone.

Every judgment is a recorded model call: the search terms (and fresh ones when the walk runs dry with steps left), each
next move, the chain, the letter. The code looks things
up (the views of pages.Layer and `initiatives`) and checks what the model returns, and decides nothing else:
- each hop of the chain is above the program office in the organization tree and of its level, no level the tree holds
  is skipped, and the program office was opened and buys (a program office, a technical office, a department or a field
  activity, never a command or a contracting office);
- every requirement and initiative was shown, its quote is in the record verbatim, a requirement sits under the program
  office and an initiative sits under it, above it or at the department; a chain rests on a requirement, or on an
  initiative under the program office when the office shows no requirement the company could bid on;
- every person was shown and the record ties them to the chain; every route was shown and leads into the chain;
- the letter goes to a chosen person or route, cites chosen records, names no other person, and every number, date and
  identifier in it is in the evidence or the profile.
A failed check gets up to two repair calls that list the problems; a run that still fails is kept and marked refused. A
profile the record holds nothing for comes back with no chain and no letter.
