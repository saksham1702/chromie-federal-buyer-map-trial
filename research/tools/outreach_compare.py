"""Our outreach walk against an agent out of the box: the same profiles, the same question, and each answer checked by
the same record checks and by a second model that sees no labels.

The arms:
- ours: the saved outreach run (research/results/outreach/<slug>.json);
- web: Claude Code headless in an empty folder with web search and fetch only, given a targeted prompt;
- repo: Claude Code headless in a copy of this repository's data, with the walk, its cassettes and its runs removed and
  no model key reachable, and no web.
Every session loads no user or project settings and no MCP servers, so no user instructions, hooks or memories reach
it (a bare session would also drop the web tools), and the whole transcript is kept.

Every answer is put in one shape: the chain; requirements and initiatives, each with identifier, quote and source;
people with source; the letter. Then two checks:
- record checks: outreach's own chain and letter checks on a walk that has seen every office, record, person and route,
  so only what the record contradicts or lacks fails. A public identifier maps to a forecast key or to the record whose
  text carries it; one that maps to nothing is not counted false, the verifier decides it;
- a blind verifier: one clean headless session per answer, labelled only by number, that opens each source and gives a
  verdict per record, chain edge, person and fact in the letter.
