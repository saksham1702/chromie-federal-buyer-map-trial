Three sources, each node resting on a dated observation in the source's own words:

- The Office of the ASA(ALT) organization chart (PDF): the Assistant Secretary, the six Portfolio Acquisition
  Executives (PAE), the fourteen PMEs, PEO ACWA, CPE Enterprise Software and Services, the Army Contracting Command,
  and the leader each box names (`leads`, with the role the box prints). The chart places a PME under a PAE only by
  column, so that edge is `inferred` and says so. Staff boxes (DASAs, deputies without a portfolio, USAASC, PIT) are
  not requirement owners and are left out.
- The Army Materiel Command acquisition forecast: the PEO, JPEO and CPE commands its Command column names and the
  program offices its PM / Directorate column names under each, as the forecast prints them. These are the names
  the forecast and the notices still carry; no source here states which PAE or PME succeeded which PEO, so none is
  claimed.
- SAM.gov federal organization records: the Army, AMC, ACC and the contracting offices the profile sweeps, with
  the DoDAAC each record states and the hierarchy it prints.

Every record is `review_status: draft` and carries `generator: org_memory_army`; a rebuild is byte for byte the
same while the saved documents are.
