"""Plan a promotion of the Navy export into the production agency-intelligence tables.

    python research/tools/promote_plan.py [--db NAME] [--snapshot DIR] [--offices FILE]
    python research/tools/promote_plan.py ... --emit-sql FILE   # write the load file
    python research/tools/promote_plan.py --selfcheck

Read-only against production. It never writes there and holds no code that could:
the only production calls are GET, and the SQL it emits goes to a file for a person
to read and run.

Why a plan rather than a push. The production layer tables are append-only - both
UPDATE and DELETE raise - so a row inserted against the wrong office cannot be
removed, only retracted. Production already holds many of the offices under its own
ids, while the export minted its own, so a straight copy would create duplicate
program offices that un-deletable assertions then point at. Everything here exists to
make that mismatch visible before anything is written.

Offices. An agency-level row matches production's row for the same agency. Otherwise
an office code carries the claim, an exact name or alias counts only when the types
agree, and anything matching two production rows is refused rather than guessed. An
office production does not know under any name, acronym or code is created under its
mapped parent. One that shares any of those with a production row, whatever its type,
is held with everything pointing at it until --offices names the production row or
says "new".

--snapshot DIR reads production from DIR/<table>.json and fetches a missing table once
(GET), so the plan and the file's guard describe the same production state. The file
stops before writing if the production offices it relies on changed since then. It
writes transactions of at most 1,000 parent rows, each child with its parent, and every
insert skips a row whose primary key exists, so a partly applied file can be rerun;
any other unique collision stops it. FILE.manifest.csv lists every inserted id and
FILE.check.sql counts the ones production lacks.
