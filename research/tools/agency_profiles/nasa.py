"""The NASA profile: Headquarters, its mission directorates, the centers, JPL (an FFRDC) and the NASA Shared Services
Center, read by the same tools as the Navy, DARPA and Army layers.

Codes as the sources state them on 2026-09-26: USAspending toptier 080 (one subtier, 8000, with thirteen awarding offices
in FY2026), SAM.gov organizations 100000266 (department) and 100000267 (agency) with the thirteen offices under the
agency, each carrying its FAR 4.1603 office code (80GSFC, 80JSC0, 80NSSC ...). The forecast is the Agency-Wide
Acquisition Forecast workbook the Office of Procurement publishes (hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/forecast).
SBIR/STTR topics are deferred (NASA's are not on the DoD portal) and so is the budget.
"""

# The Agency-Wide Acquisition Forecast (AcqForecastNew.xlsx, sheet "Forecast", one header row). The buying office (a
# center or an agency office by its abbreviation: KSC, JSC, NSSC, ITPO, HQ, IV&V) is the owning office; its internal
# code, the mission directorate and the item's SourceID ride along. The SourceID is a bare list number, so it is kept
# as a column and is no row's PID. A longer header sits before the one it starts with (the reader takes the first
# prefix that matches).
