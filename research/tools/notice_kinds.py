"""What a SAM.gov special notice announces, read by a model from its title and text.

A special notice is SAM.gov's catch-all: the same type carries an industry day, a notice of intent to award a sole source,
a ceiling increase on a running contract, a workload forecast or a call for white papers. The model reads each one and
names one kind from a fixed list, or none, and copies the words of the notice that state it; the reading is kept only
when those words are in the notice verbatim. `trace.signal_kind` uses a kept reading and falls back to the title's
keywords otherwise, so a notice the model leaves unread is typed as before.
