"""Stakeholders: who plays which part when an office buys, and the evidence for each part.

Every person the layer knows (people.json) is placed in the buckets below. Each bucket rests on evidence rows, every
row with its source and date, and says how it was reached: "listed" (the agency lists the role), "stated" (a source
says it in words: a biography, the program listing naming the manager, the budget book), "self-stated" (the person's
public LinkedIn profile) or "inferred" (read from signals).

  decision_maker    the agency's director, an office's director or deputy (listed)
  budget_holder     the manager of a program the budget book funds this fiscal year or next (stated: the listing names
                    the manager, the book the money); a manager whose programs the book does not match is one by role.
                    Where the books name no manager (the Navy), the one person a current record places in an office's
                    single post (its program manager, its program executive officer) holds the programs tied to that
                    office (inferred: programs.py records how each program was tied)
  budget_process    an office's assistant director for program management and its program analysts, who run budget
                    formulation, execution and justification and so know what is left (listed)
  problem_owner     the manager of a program whose book states the need; anyone whose biography states research
                    interests or whose recorded remarks state a capability priority; the requirements contact and the
                    alternate a forecast record names for its office's requirement (stated)
  champion          a problem owner or decision maker with two or more signals of acting now: new in the post, a
                    program that grows next year or starts, a solicitation out, talks to industry, an industry
                    background (inferred; every signal carries its evidence)
  technical         deputy program managers, innovation fellows, support contractors posted to the agency (listed)
  end_user_liaison  an operational liaison a service posts to the agency (stated in the biography)
  contracting       the contacts on solicitations; a shared mailbox is marked and never counted as a person (stated)
  small_business    the small business office's staff (listed)

Organizations a program's book names are kept on the program as its named users and partners, a transition partner
when "transition" is in the same sentence; people there are not collected.

A person the agency publishes no biography of is looked up in Exa's index of public LinkedIn profiles, and a program
office no known person leads is searched the same way (`collect`). A profile is used only when the name matches and a
current or recent post names the agency or the office; a profile that matches the name alone is kept as a candidate
and used for nothing. A discovered person is used only when a current post names the office's code or full name.
