"""Per program office: who owns which problem, who would champion a fix, who holds the budget; the budget line by line
(requested, enacted, spent this fiscal year, roughly left); what the office bought and is working on now. Read from the
frozen record and the saved files alone, for whichever agency profile is set, and written as one JSON and one Markdown
report under the profile's results folder.

Three kinds of statement are kept apart, as the working agreement asks, and the JSON keeps them under three keys:

- `facts`: what a saved page, sheet, feed or record states, each row with its citation (URL, the ledger's retrieval date
  and sha256 prefix, a locator into the document, the passage or field). A listed role is a fact about the listing and
  nothing more: it never says who decides a buy.
- `inferences`: readings built from named facts, each row labelled `inference` with the rule it rests on and the fact ids
  it used. "Who would champion a fix" is always an inference: no page says who champions anything. "Who holds the budget"
  is an ordered inference: the line (statutory), the office the line's programs are placed in (by a stated basis), the
  office's listed head, the office above it. "Roughly what is left" is enacted less the obligations the saved feed shows,
  with the reasons it is a floor.
- `recommendations`: how to use the above, drafted and unreviewed.

A family the profile never collected is stated as a boundary ("0 budget lines read; no book saved for this profile")
before any section that would otherwise read "none".
