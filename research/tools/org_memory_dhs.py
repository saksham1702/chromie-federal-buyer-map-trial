"""Read the Department of Homeland Security's own records into the organization memory (the `memory` stage of the dhs profile).

    AGENCY=dhs python research/tools/org_memory_dhs.py build           # research/agencies/dhs/memory/organization_seed.json

    python research/tools/org_memory_dhs.py --selfcheck

Three sources, each node resting on a dated observation in the source's own words:

- SAM.gov federal organization records: the department's own record, the hierarchy listing of its components (the
  next level under the department) and the listing of each contracting component, with the office code (AAC) each
  entry states and the parent path it prints. Two offices stand past the first hundred entries of their component's
  listing (USCG HQ Contract Operations, the ICE Information Technology Division) and are read from their own records.
- USAspending: the FY2026 awarding sub-agencies and offices of toptier 070, with the obligations the answer states;
  the offices seeded are each component's largest awarders there (the profile lists them).
- The Acquisition Planning Forecast System (APFS) records, as the API behind the forecast page answers them: the
  Organization and Requirements Office columns name the requirement offices under each component, and the
  Contracting Office column of a headquarters row prints the office code beside the division that buys for it.

Every record is `review_status: draft` and carries `generator: org_memory_dhs`; a rebuild is byte for byte the same
while the saved documents are.
