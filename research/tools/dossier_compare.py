"""Claude on the platform's tools against Claude with the web, on one request that needs everything the platform
answers: the outreach walk (company capability to program office, requirements, people and one letter) and around it a
dossier with one section for each thing the platform answers. A verifier that sees neither label then checks both
answers side by side, one section at a time.

The arms are outreach_compare's: platform (the navy MCP server only, no shell, no files, no web) and web (web search and
fetch only). The request names no tool; each section lists the parts it must cover.

Rules:
- Use only what was public on or before {as_of}; answer as of that day.
- Every requirement and initiative needs its identifier (a forecast, solicitation, notice, topic or contract number), a
  quote copied exactly from its source, and the source: a URL, or a file path with the sheet row or line.
- Every person needs their title, their e-mail if public, and the source that ties them to that office.
- Name each office exactly as its source writes it; leave a level empty only when the office sits under none.
- Every dossier claim is one fact with the identifier it rests on (a record number, an office code or a person's name),
  a quote copied exactly from its source, and the source. A claim states what a source says: never claim that
  something does not exist, or that a record or the web holds none of it; what you could not find goes in the
  section's not_found.
- The letter uses only facts from your sources and the profile, and claims nothing about the company beyond the profile.
- Never forecast: never write likely, probably, imminent, expected, soon, "will release" or "RFP coming".
- When no Navy office buys what the company sells, answer fit false and give the reason in one sentence.
