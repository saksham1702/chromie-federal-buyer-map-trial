"""Turn the Navy org memory and the LRAE datapacks into SQL for the prod agency-intelligence schema.

    python research/tools/agency_layers_sql.py > /tmp/navy_layers.sql
    psql "$LOCAL_DB" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f /tmp/navy_layers.sql
    python research/tools/agency_layers_sql.py --selfcheck

Reads research/memory/organization_seed.json (offices, observations, relationships, readings)
and datapack/lrae_*/layers/*.csv (needs, requirements, funding, procurement
references, evidence). Writes SQL against the tables the production migrations
`reconcile_agency_intelligence_prerequisites` and `agency_program_intelligence`
create. No network, no database driver, stdlib only, so the same inputs always
produce the same bytes.

The production model puts everything time-varying on `gov_intelligence_assertions`:
one dated, evidence-backed claim with a basis, a rationale and an optional
supersession, and a thin typed detail row keyed on `assertion_id`. Evidence is an
Agency Brain item wrapped in `gov_intelligence_evidence`. A `documented` assertion
will not commit without direct supporting evidence, so every claim here is written
with its detail and its citation in the same transaction.

Every id is a uuid5 of a fixed namespace and the record's own key, so re-running
inserts nothing. Nothing invents a value a source does not carry: rows the schema
cannot accept are counted and reported on stderr rather than padded.

One requirement, one need, every release a revision of it. Rows the release diffs tie
with `confirmed` (the same PID, or the same title under the same office code; see
`lrae_package.fold_map`) load under one key, so a tool reading the database alone sees
the full history. A row tied without carrying the PID itself writes its assertions with
basis `inferred` and the tie (basis, the two rows, the diff) in the rationale; the need's
description names it too. A chain the fold refuses (two PIDs, or two rows of one release)
loads as separate records and is reported on stderr.

Two more things ride on columns the production tables already have, so no table is added.
`research/sources/source_registry.json` loads into `gov_procurement_sources`, one row per source the
research inspected. Every Brain item the loader writes for a spreadsheet row, a SAM.gov notice
or an article carries `source_provider` (that registry row's key), `source_tier`,
`published_at` and, where the row is something that happened, `event_type`: a forecast line's
first release, a release that moved it, a notice by its type, an article by what it reports.
A release that restates a line as it was is no event. Three items are derived rather than read:
a leadership change at an office on a dated day, an incumbent contract's end as FPDS last stated
it, and each article claim that reports something that happened.
